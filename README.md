- I'm called Gabriel, but my nickname is "Gabs". I'm a **Computer Science** student at Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso, Brazil.
- I have interest in learning things as them are constructed since by the smallest parts.
- Currently, I'm working as a front-end developer on a governamental department of my state, called Secretaria de Estado da Fazenda — SEFAZ.
- I think that I don't have a prefered field of study by the moment; I just do what I have to do.
- My most liked programming language — and that I have more experience using it — is Java, but I have knowledges in others doing some college projects using C, C++ and Python. I did a R course too, he was focused on data analysis using machine learning, but was very introductional.
